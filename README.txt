The project was created with eclipse Java EE.

It need to be set with a server. (I used Tomcat v7.0 locally for my tests)

Project -> Properties -> Targeted Runtimes -> "set the server to use"

******************************************************************************

The elipse project build path need to be configured.

Project -> Build Path -> Configure Build Path -> Defaut output folder: -> "Project Name/WebContent/WEB-INF/classes"
